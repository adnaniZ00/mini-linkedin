Setup Instructions (Local Development)
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)

npm or Yarn

MongoDB (running locally or accessible via a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

1. Clone the Repository
   git clone [https://github.com/adnaniZ00/mini-linkedin.git]
   cd mini-linkedin-platform # Or whatever your root folder is named

2. Backend Setup (Server)
   Navigate to the server directory, install dependencies, and start the server.

cd server
npm install # or yarn install

Create a .env file in the server directory:

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
PORT=5000

Replace your_mongodb_connection_string_here with your MongoDB connection string (e.g., mongodb://localhost:27017/minilinkedin for local or an Atlas URI).

Replace your_jwt_secret_key_here with a strong, random string (e.g., generated from node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))").

Start the Backend Server:

npm start # or yarn start

The server should start on http://localhost:5000.

3. Frontend Setup (Client)
   Open a new terminal window, navigate to the client directory, install dependencies, and start the frontend.

cd ../client # Go back to root, then into client
npm install # or yarn install

Create a .env file in the client directory:

REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

This points your local frontend to your local backend.

Start the Frontend Development Server:

npm start # or yarn start

The frontend should open in your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or another available port).
